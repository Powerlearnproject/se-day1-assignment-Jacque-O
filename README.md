Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. 
Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry because it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, such as communication, commerce, entertainment, agriculture, and healthcare. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-The development of programming languages( FORTRAN)
-The development of software engineering as a discipline 1960s.
-The advent of structured programming.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design- Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation- Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
Testing- Conducting tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment- Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance- Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall approach has distinct phases e.g. Requirements, Design, and implementation flowing like a waterfall. Whereas in agile methodologies the approach is iterative and incremental focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. 
Waterfall: Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change, such as building a bridge or developing a regulatory compliance system.
Agile: Ideal for projects where requirements may evolve, such as software startups, mobile app development, or any project needing frequent updates and user feedback.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software  developer-Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality assurance engineer- Responsible for ensuring software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project manager- Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of a software project.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g.Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc
Version control systems track changes to source code and coordinate team members e.g Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements.
Tight deadlines.
Technical debt.
Suboptimal solutions.
The above challenges can be overcome by effective communication, using agile methodologies, task prioritization, and regular reassessing of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is the testing of the modules of software.
Integration testing is the testing of interactions between different components or subsystems.
System testing is testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing is testing against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to crafting questions to get the best possible response from AI models. It helps the user to get correct answers.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt- How to bake a cake.
correct Prompt- write for me a Recipe and instructions for baking a moist chocolate cake.
The improved prompt is more effective because it contains keywords that guide the Ai model to know exactly what I want.
